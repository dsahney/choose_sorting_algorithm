After learning about some of the classic sorting algorithms, I decided to create a project on it, implementing runtimes as well.

A user will input a list of integers, and will be told the maximum and minimum value of the integers in the list.
Rather than looping over the list to find the maximum and minimum valued integers in the list, I have instead chosen to sort the list from least to greatest, and then compare the sorted list at the first and last indices (index 0 and -1, respectively).
The user will recieve a recommendation as to which algorithm is best to use, to minimize runtime.
